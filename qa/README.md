# QA candidate challenge goal
Check your basic skills in specifying test scenarios and plus UI testing automation of these scenarios.
Therefore, you must describe scenarios for at least **THREE** navigation areas (features) of the Airbank Website (https://joinairbank.com/).

## Must contain
* Test specification of the chosen areas of the Website;
* Each test specification must contain at least one test scenario;
* Each test specification must be automated using the [Cypress framework](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress#End-to-end).

## Submission process
The candidate must implement the solution in a new repository (private one) with the solution. The process works as follows:
1. Candidate will create a private repository;
2. Candidate will put `tatidutrab`, `ErickPetru` as collaborators in this new repository that must be created specifically for this challenge.
3. So, the candidate will commit and push all changes to his/her new repository created.

## Documentation
* The goal of this topic is to explain how was the process to choose the website areas for specification and test automation. This step can be sent after all changes in candidate's new repository is completed. Please, sending us an email notifying the challenge completion.
Also share with us briefly how was your test development process from start to finish - suggestions on how to explain this process could be: *(1)* Recording a loom; or *(2)* writing/documenting how to run the project.

## Note
* Feel free to use Cypress patterns and best practices as you see fit for this challenge.

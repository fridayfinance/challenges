# QA Engineer Challenge

At **[Friday Finance](https://fridayfinance.com/)** we use many tools, technologies and integrations to third-party service providers, a certainly challenging situation when it comes to ensure quality. We appreciate a quality mindset that overcomes just a Quality Assurance department, since we value quality as something to be broadly spread across Product, Design & Engineering in overral. But this doesn't mean we don't need people dedicated to Quality Assurance, thus QA Engineers are a fundamental role in our softwares lyfecycle.

With this technical challenge, our main is to check your basic skills in specifying test scenarios + UI testing automation of these scenarios. Therefore, you must describe scenarios for at least **TWO** navigation areas (features) of the [Friday Finance website](https://fridayfinance.com/).

## Must contain

* Test specification of the chosen areas of the Website;
* Each test specification must contain at least one test scenario;
* Each test specification must be automated by using the [Cypress framework](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress#End-to-end).

## Submission process
The candidate must implement the solution in a new repository (private one) with the solution. The process works as follows:
1. Candidate will create a private repository specifically for this challenge;
2. Candidate will put [@tatidutrab](https://github.com/tatidutrab) and [@Fastova](https://github.com/Fastova) as collaborators in this new repository;
3. So, the candidate will commit and push all changes to his/her new repository created.

## Documentation

The goal of this topic is to explain how was the process to choose the website areas for specification and test automation. This step can be sent after all changes in candidate's new repository is completed. Please, remeber to notify your person of touch at Friday Finance about the challenge completion.

Inside this documentation topic, it's also essential to share with us briefly how was your test automation development process, from start to finish. To do so, consider creating either:

1. A video recording showing the running project;
2. A written document on how to run the project.

## Automation

Feel free to use Cypress patterns and best practices, as you see fit for this challenge.

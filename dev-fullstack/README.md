# Full-Stack Developer Challenge

At **[Airbank](https://joinairbank.com/)** we use many tools, technologies and integrations to third-party service providers, but our core application stack is currently based on [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/), [Node](https://nodejs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).

About full-stack developers and the tech stack, we have two strong beliefs here:
1. Everyone can (and should) be full-stack, writing all the layers of the solution. We are a customer centric company, and users just want working features, not shine pieces of code in a layer of abstraction they will never see. Yes, good code is a must, but only code that delivers the desired features.
2. Developers can't be "married" to their beloved technologies of the fashion. Being able to write good JavaScript is more important than being the bigger TypeScript evangelist, being an excellent SQL writer is more important than knowing all about the latest ORM. We shown our current stack, but we target developers that won't complain if (for an hypothetical very good business reason) we maybe want to change Vue to native Web Components, or maybe from Node to Deno, or maybe remove Prisma and create our own in-house ORM...

Therefore, this technical challenge for the full-stack developer role is focused in **being able to quickly adapt to our stack** (even if you aren't used to something in it), **being able to offer an end-to-end solution to the problem** (from the interface to the database), and **being able to show good decisions based on attention to details** (after all, software development is a science, but also an art of crafting the best experience possible in each feature you put your hands on).

## TLDR

The challenge is to create a small SPA that exhibits a page with a table of financial transactions, which can be filtered by account and by date range (start month and end month), and a sub page with the transaction details after clicking a row of the previous table. Use the technologies of our stack as you can (preferably all), but TypeScript is expected only for the back-end. A [transactions CSV file](./data/transactions.csv) with a bunch of sample data is attached to this repository.

There's no mandatory layout to copy, but we propose to show something simple yet organized in a minimalist way. Take the image as a bare example, not a strict design to follow.

## Technical Details

If you're not lazy enough for stop right in the [TLDR](#tldr), nice! Here are step by step explanations to you.

### Setup the Database

To create the database, the best scenario is if you can follow the schema-first strategy with Prisma, first creating a schema file that describes each entity (with proper normalization in mind), then generating SQL migrations to build the relational DB.

To populate the database, the best scenario is if you can leverage Prisma's seed feature to automatically fill the tables with the sample data we provide as CSV files for [transactions](./data/transactions.csv), [accounts](./data/accounts.csv), and [categories](./data/categories.csv).

### Building the API

To build the API, the best scenario is if you can do based on Apollo Server, using schema-first strategy with GraphQL tags, with every resolver properly TypeScript typed, and using Prisma features to communicate with the database.

You're free to structure your API architecture following your own decisions about organization, modules, abstraction, reusability... But be prepared to explain your decisions.

### Building the App

To create the SPA, the best scenario is if you can do with Vue and Nuxt, however you're free to choose between Vue/Nuxt 2, or Vue/Nuxt 3. As already mentioned, TypeScript in the front-end is not required, but if you decide to use, enable all strict enforcements because we don't like to see `any` anywhere.

To visually enhance the pages, the best scenario is if you can do with TailwindCSS 3, but if you want to show incredible raw CSS abilities, feel free to go this way. Remember to be prepared to explain any decision you did.

Finally, we are here to see your own abilities on writing code, not on getting others code. We don't like to see third-party Vue components in use, it's extremely recommended to write your own components, or just use native browser elements if you can't.

## FAQ

### Where and how do I need to publish the solution?

Nothing special. If you can provide a link to a public GitHub repository with a good `README.md`, all good. No need to deploy it anywhere (unless you really want to do that to show something special). During the meeting we'll arrange with you after the challenge, you will show us the solution by sharing your screen, so for real the deploy really doesn't matter.

### What about the transaction details sub page?

Just decide the best way you think all the data of that transaction should be shown. Of course an end user wouldn't wanna see ids, so use the proper entity relations to show only names of foreign entities.

### Do I need to use all that transactions in the CSV?!

Yes, we crafted with love a batch with `349933` sample transactions. This way, you can show us that you know how to work with large sets of data without compromising performance. It's a super important part of the challenge. ðŸ˜‰

### What is the desired behavior of functionality X?

Anything not explicitly described is open to your decision. But remember that **attention to details** is a core value being evaluated here, most of the requirements is documented here in a way or another.

### I don't know technology Y, is it mandatory?

We love to see people trying to fit to our stack, even if without previous experience in part of that. Remember that **being able to quickly adapt to our stack** is a core value being evaluated here, but that being said, you're free to show the best you can, the way you believe you should.

### What is more important, the code structure or the way the pages work?

Both. Dot.

### I won't have time to finish the challenge in time, what to do?

The challenge usually don't have a strict deadline, it's your choice to deliver in time with less functionality, or be late in one or two days to deliver something exceptionally good. Remember to be prepared to explain any decision you did.

### I'm a blazing incredible senior, why a code challenge?

In our experience, it's more rare than finding rhodium to find developers totally experienced in all technologies a company uses. Here we like to level developers based on the fit to our needs, not based on other arbitrary metrics like years since graduation.

But we don't want to insult anyone! If you are sure that you are at a unique level of excellence in our entire stack, and you have some good examples of this excellence in public repositories, just send some links to us and we will gladly skip the challenge.

### What is the next step in this hiring process?

After you send us the confirmation of the challenge completed with the repository hyperlink, we'll arrange a meeting with you some days later, then you will show us the solution and the code by sharing your screen. Anything after that will depends, but we wish you all the luck. ðŸ™‚

### I have more questions about this challenge, how to ask?

Not needed. Just follow with attention all that was explained here, and decide what else you need to. Your decisions are part of the evaluation.

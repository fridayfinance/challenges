# Dev fullstack candidate challenge goal

Create a SPA that exhibits a page with a table of financial transactions that can be filtered by date range (start month/end month), and a page with the transaction details on click. Use Vue, GraphQL, Prisma (ORM) & Postgres. Use TypeScript in the back-end. A CSV file with the transactions is attached to this repository.

No need for any fancy styling on the page example:
